Its breakthrough came during World War II when it mass-produced penicillin using deep-tank fermentation, transforming the antibiotic into a widely available medicine. This innovation established Pfizer as a global pharmaceutical leader. Over the decades, the company expanded its portfolio with groundbreaking treatments, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, vaccines, and oncology therapies. Notably, Pfizer co-developed the first mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, in partnership with BioNTech, which became a pivotal tool in combating the pandemic. Today, Pfizer remains a leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on research, innovation, and public health solutions.",
