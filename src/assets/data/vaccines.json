ReactogenicityMyalgia; arthralgia; fever; rigors; asthenia.Safety Rarely, VAPP may occur (1/1.4-2.8 million).Vaccination GoalIndividual protection; outbreak control.OthersHIV-infected individuals should be immunized according to WHO official recommendations; fecal excretion of the vaccine viruses may persist in the week following immunization and may also be transmitted to the contacts of the vaccinees; in premature or low birth weight infants, vaccination must be performed at chronological age, without correction related to duration of pregnancy (gestational age) or birth weight.",
